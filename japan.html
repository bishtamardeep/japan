        island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It consists of a great
        string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc that stretches for
        approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through the western North Pacific
        Ocean. Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the country’s four
        main islands; from north to south these are Hokkaido (Hokkaidō), Honshu
        (Honshū), Shikoku, and Kyushu (Kyūshū). Honshu is the largest of the
        four, followed in size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. In addition,
        there are numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are the
        Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands (including the island of Okinawa) to the south
        and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin (Ogasawara), and Volcano (Kazan)
        islands to the south and east of central Honshu. The national capital,
        Tokyo (Tōkyō), in east-central Honshu, is one of the world’s most
        populous cities.

        The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the land
        surface consisting of mountains. There are many active and dormant
        volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an elevation of
        12,388 feet (3,776 meters), is Japan’s highest mountain. Abundant
        precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most of the
        country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite the
        mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it possible to
        raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a great extent,
        ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily concentrated in the
        low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country
        possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that,
        since 1950, has emerged as one of the world’s most economically and
        technologically advanced societies. Heavy emphasis is placed on
        education, and Japan is one of the world’s most literate countries.
        Tension between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life.
        A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a concern with form
        and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in
        Japan’s ubiquitous gardens. Even in the countryside, however, the impact
        of rapid Westernization is evident in many aspects of Japanese life. The
        agricultural regions are characterized by low population densities and
        well-ordered rice fields and fruit orchards, whereas the industrial and
        urbanized belt along the Pacific coast of Honshu is noted for its highly
        concentrated population, heavy industrialization, and environmental
        pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have occupied Japan for tens of thousands of years, but Japan’s
        recorded history begins only in the 1st century bce, with mention in
        Chinese sources. Contact with China and Korea in the early centuries ce
        brought profound changes to Japan, including the Chinese writing system,
        Buddhism, and many artistic forms from the continent. The first steps at
        political unification of the country occurred in the late 4th and early
        5th centuries ce under the Yamato court. A great civilization then
        developed first at Nara in the 8th century and then at Heian-kyō (now
        Kyōto) from the late 8th to the late 12th century. The seven centuries
        thereafter were a period of domination by military rulers culminating in
        near isolation from the outside world from the early 17th to the
        mid-19th century.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reopening of the country ushered in contact with the West and a time
        of unprecedented change. Japan sought to become a modern industrialized
        nation and pursued the acquisition of a large overseas empire, initially
        in Korea and China. By late 1941 this latter policy caused direct
        confrontation with the United States and its allies and to defeat in
        World War II (1939–45). Since the war, however, Japan’s spectacular
        economic growth—one of the greatest of any nation in that period—brought
        the country to the forefront of the world economy. It now is one of the
        world’s foremost manufacturing countries and traders of goods and is a
        global financial leader.
      </p>
      <h2>land</h2>
      <p>
        Japan is bounded to the west by the Sea of Japan (East Sea), which
        separates it from the eastern shores of South and North Korea and
        southeastern Siberia (Russia); to the north by La Perouse (Sōya) Strait,
        separating it from Russian-held Sakhalin Island, and by the Sea of
        Okhotsk; to the northeast by the southern Kuril Islands (since World War
        II under Soviet and then Russian administration); to the east and south
        by the Pacific; and to the southwest by the East China Sea, which
        separates it from China. The island of Tsushima lies between
        northwestern Kyushu and southeastern South Korea and defines the Korea
        Strait on the Korean side and the Tsushima Strait on the Japanese side.
      </p>
      <h2>relief</h2>
      <p>
        The mountainous character of the country is the outcome of orogenic
        (mountain-building) forces largely during Quaternary time (roughly, the
        past 2.6 million years), as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of
        violent earthquakes, volcanic activity, and signs of change in sea
        levels along the coast. There are no sizable structural plains and
        peneplains (large land areas leveled by erosion), features that usually
        occur in more stable regions of the Earth. The mountains are for the
        most part in a youthful stage of dissection in which steep slopes are
        incised by dense river-valley networks. Rivers are mostly torrential,
        and their valleys are accompanied by series of river terraces that are
        the result of movements in the Earth’s crust, as well as climatic and
        sea-level changes in Holocene times (i.e., the past 11,700 years).
        Recent volcanoes are juxtaposed with old and highly dissected ones. The
        shores are characterized by elevated and depressed features such as
        headlands and bays, which display an incipient stage of development
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountains are divided into many small land blocks that are separated
        by lowlands or deep saddles; there is no long or continuous mountain
        range. These land blocks are the result of intense faulting (movement of
        adjacent rock masses along a fracture) and warping (bending of the
        Earth’s crust); the former process is regarded as dominant. One
        consequence is that mountain blocks are often bounded by fault scarps
        and flexure slopes that descend in step formation to the adjacent
        lowlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coalescing alluvial fans—cone-shaped deposits of alluvium that run
        together—are formed where rivers emerge from the mountains. When the
        rivers are large enough to extend their courses to the sea, low deltaic
        plains develop in front of the fans; this occurs most frequently where
        the rivers empty into shallow and sheltered bays, as in the deltas of
        Kantō (Kwanto), Nōbi, and Ōsaka. In most places, however, fan surfaces
        plunge directly into the sea and are separated by low, sandy beach
        ridges.

        Dissected plains are common. Intense disturbances have caused many
        former alluvial fans, deltas, and sea bottoms to be substantially
        uplifted to form flat-topped uplands such as those found in the Kantō
        Plain. Frequently the uplands have been overlain with volcanic ash, as
        in the Kantō and Tokachi plains.
      </p>
      <h2>Geologic framework</h2>
      <p>
        Japan is one of the world’s most geologically unstable areas. The
        country experiences some 1,000 tremors annually, most of them minor,
        though major quakes—as in Tokyo-Yokohama in 1923 and Kōbe in 1995—cause
        considerable loss of life and widespread destruction. Violent volcanic
        eruptions occur frequently, and at least 60 volcanoes have been active
        within historical time. Volcanoes born since 1900 include Shōwa Volcano
        on Hokkaido and Myōjin Rock off the Beyoneisu (or Bayonnaise) Rocks in
        the Pacific. Among the major eruptions since 1980 are those of Mounts O
        (1983) and Mihara (1986) in the Izu Islands and Mount Unzen (1991) in
        Kyushu. The country’s abundant hot springs are mostly of volcanic
        origin. Many of the gigantic volcanoes are conical in shape (e.g., Mount
        Fuji), while others form steep lava domes (e.g., Mounts Dai and Unzen).
        Conspicuous shield volcanoes (broad, gently sloping volcanic cones) are
        rare, and extensive lava plateaus are lacking. One of the
        characteristics of the volcanic areas is the prevalence of calderas
        (large, circular, basin-shaped volcanic depressions), especially in the
        northeast and southwest, many of which are filled with water, such as
        Lakes Kutcharo, Towada, and Ashi.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cause of this instability—indeed, the reason for Japan’s
        existence—is the tectonic movement of several of the Earth’s major
        crustal plates in the vicinity of the archipelago. Most important is the
        subduction (sinking) of the Pacific Plate (in the north) and the
        Philippine Plate (in the south) beneath the Eurasian Plate, upon which
        Japan lies. The movements of these plates have formed six mountain arcs
        off the northeastern coast of Asia: from northeast to southwest, the
        Chishima Range of the Kuril Islands; the Karafuto (Sakhalin) Mountain
        system of Hokkaido; the Northeast, Southwest, and Shichito-Mariana
        ranges of Honshu; and the Ryukyu Island formations.

      <h2>The major physiographic regions</h2>
      <div class="physiographic">
        <p>
          These mountain arcs, in turn, generally correspond to Japan’s major
          physiographic regions: the four regions of Japan proper
          (Hondo)—Hokkaido, Northeastern (Tōhoku), Central (Chūbu), and
          Southwestern—and the Ryukyu and Bonin archipelagoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hokkaido Region was formed by the coalescence of the Chishima and
          Karafuto arcs. The backbone of the region is aligned north to south.
          The Chishima arc enters Hokkaido as three volcanic chains with
          elevations above 6,000 feet (1,800 meters); these are arranged in
          ladder formation and terminate in the heart of the region. Chief
          components of the mountain system are the Kitami Mountains in the
          north and the Hidaka Range in the south. Lake Towada Lake TowadaLake
          Towada, Towada-Hachimantai National Park, northern Honshu, Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Northeastern Region nearly coincides with the northeastern
          mountain arc and stretches from southwest Hokkaido to central Honshu.
          Several rows of mountains, lowlands, and volcanic zones are closely
          oriented to the general trend of the insular arc of this region, which
          is convex toward the Pacific Ocean. The Kitakami and Abukuma ranges on
          the east coast are somewhat oblique to the general trend; they are
          chiefly composed of older rocks, and plateaulike landforms survive in
          the center. In the western zone the formations conform to the general
          trend and are composed of a basement complex overlain by thick
          accumulations of young rocks that have been subjected to mild folding.
          The Ōu Mountains, capped with towering volcanoes that form the main
          part of the East Japan Volcanic Belt, are separated from the coastal
          ranges by the Kitakami-Abukuma lowlands to the east and by a row of
          basins in the west.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Central Region of central and western Honshu is dominated by the
          coalescence of the Northeast, Southwest, and Shichito-Mariana mountain
          arcs near Mount Fuji. The trend of the mountains, lowlands, and
          volcanic zones intersects the island almost at right angles. The most
          notable physical feature is the Fossa Magna, a great rift lowland that
          traverses the widest portion of Honshu from the Sea of Japan to the
          Pacific. It is partially occupied by mountains and volcanoes of the
          southern part of the East Japan Volcanic Belt. Intermontane basins are
          sandwiched between the lofty, partially glaciated central mountain
          knots of the Akaishi, Kiso, and Hida ranges (which together form the
          Japanese Alps) to the west and the Kantō Range to the east. The
          shallow structural basin of the Kantō Plain, which stretches to the
          east of the Kantō Range, is the most extensive lowland of Japan; the
          immense metropolis of Tokyo spreads out from its center, covering a
          vast area of the plain.
        </p>
        <img src="japan-sky-street.jpeg" alt="street-of-japan" />
        <p>
          The Southwestern Region—which includes western Honshu (Chūgoku), as
          well as Shikoku and northern Kyushu—generally coincides with the
          southwestern mountain arc, and the general trend of highlands and
          lowlands is roughly convex toward the Sea of Japan. The region is
          divided into the Inner Zone, formed by complex faulting, and the Outer
          Zone, formed by warping. The Inner Zone is chiefly composed of ancient
          granites, rocks of Paleozoic age (250 to 540 million years old), and
          geologically more recent volcanic rocks, which are arranged in
          complicated juxtaposition. The Outer Zone, consisting of the Akaishi,
          Kii, Shikoku, and Kyushu mountain groups, in contrast, is
          characterized by a regular zonal arrangement from north to south of
          crystalline schists and Paleozoic, Mesozoic (65 to 250 million years
          old), and Cenozoic (formed within the past 65 million years)
          formations. The outstanding surface features of the Inner Zone
          (centered on the Chūgoku Range) present a highly complex mosaic of
          numerous fault blocks, while those of the Outer Zone are continuous
          except where the sea straits separate them into the four independent
          groups. The Inland Sea (Seto-naikai) is the region where the greater
          amount of depression has resulted in the invasion of sea waters. The
          northern edge of the Inner Zone is studded with gigantic lava domes
          formed by Mount Dai, which, together with volcanic Mount Aso, bury a
          considerable part of the western extension of the Inland Sea in
          central Kyushu. Mount Aso Mount AsoThe caldera of Mount Aso in central
          Kyushu, Japan

        <p>
          The Ryukyu Islands Region constitutes the main portion of the Ryukyu
          arc, which penetrates into Kyushu as the West Japan Volcanic Belt and
          terminates at Mount Aso. The influence of the arc is also seen in the
          trend of the many elongated islands off western Kyushu, including the
          Koshiki, Gotō, and Tsushima islands. The islands of the Izu-Ogasawara
          Region, to the east of the Ryukyu arc, consist of a number of
          volcanoes on the submarine ridge of the Izu-Marina arc and the Bonin
          Islands, which include Peel Island and Iwo Jima (Iō-tō).

      <h3>Drainage and soils</h3>
      <div class="drainage">
        <p>
          The increasing demand for freshwater for use in paddy (wet-rice)
          cultivation and industry and for domestic consumption is a serious
          problem. Difficulties of supply lie in the paucity of natural water
          reservoirs, the swift runoff of the rivers, and the engineering
          difficulties of constructing large-scale dams in the rugged mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japan’s rivers are generally short and swift-running and are supplied
          by small drainage basins. The most significant rivers are the Teshio
          and Ishikari rivers of Hokkaido; the Kitakami, Tone, Shinano, Kiso,
          and Tenryū rivers of Honshu; and the Chikugo River of Kyushu. Some of
          the rivers from the volcanic areas of northeastern Honshu are acidic
          and are useless for irrigation and other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lake Biwa, the largest in Japan, covers 259 square miles (670 square
          km) of central Honshu. All other major lakes are in the northeast.
          Most of the coastal lakes, such as Lakes Kasumi and Hamana of Honshu,
          are drowned former valleys, the bay mouths of which have been dammed
          by sandbars. Inland lakes such as Biwa, Suwa, and Inawashiro of Honshu
          occupy tectonic depressions of geologically recent fault origin. Lakes
          of volcanic origin (e.g., Kutcharo of Hokkaido and Towada and Ashi of
          Honshu) outnumber all other types.

      <h1>Soils of Japan</h1>
      <div class="soils">
        <p>
          The soils of Japan are customarily divided from northeast to southwest
          into a weak podzolic (soils with a thin organic mineral layer over a
          gray leached layer) zone, a brown earth zone, and a red earth zone.
          There are some local variations. The northern half of the Tōhoku area
          of northern Honshu is included in the area of brown forest soils. The
          northern tip of Hokkaido is classed as a subzone of the podzolic
          soils; the remainder of the island is included in the subzone of the
          acidic brown forest soils. Most of western Honshu is a transitional
          zone. Yellow-brown forest soils extend along the Pacific coast from
          southern Tōhoku to southern Kyushu, while red and yellow soils are
          confined to the Ryukyu Islands. The widespread reddish soils are
          generally regarded as the products of a former warmer, more humid
          climate. Immature volcanic ash soils occur on the uplands.

          (sticky, blue-gray compact) soils are found in the poorly drained
          lowlands. Peat soils occupy the moors in Hokkaido and Tōhoku. Muck
          (dark soil, containing a high percentage of organic matter) and gley
          paddy soils are the products of years of rice cultivation. Polder
          soils (those reclaimed from the sea) are widely distributed. Soil
          fertility increases in the lowlands where agriculture is practiced,
          the result of a combination of natural alluvium washed down from the
          uplands and centuries of intense reworking of the soil medium by rice
          farmers.

      <h1>Climate</h1>
      <div class="climate">
        <p>
          In general, Japan’s climate is characterized as monsoonal (i.e.,
          governed by wet and dry seasonal winds). The main influences are the
          country’s latitudinal extent, the surrounding oceans, and its
          proximity to the neighboring Asian landmass. There are numerous local
          climatic variations, the result of relief features. In winter the high
          pressure zone over eastern Siberia and the low pressure zone over the
          western Pacific result in an eastward flow of cold air (the winter
          monsoon) from late September to late March that picks up moisture over
          the Sea of Japan. The winter monsoon deposits its moisture as rain or
          snow on the side of Japan facing the Sea of Japan and brings dry,
          windy weather to the Pacific side. The pressure systems are reversed
          during the summer, and air movements from the east and south (the
          summer monsoon) from mid-April to early September bring warmer
          temperatures and rain. Cyclonic storms and frequent and destructive
          typhoons (tropical cyclones) occur during late summer and early fall,
          especially in the southwest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The warm waters of the Kuroshio (Japan Current), which corresponds in
          latitude and general directional flow to the Gulf Stream of the
          Atlantic, flow northward along Japan’s Pacific coast as far as
          latitude 35° N. The Tsushima Current branches westward from the
          Kuroshio off southern Kyushu and washes the coasts of Honshu and
          Hokkaido along the Sea of Japan; it is this current that lends
          moisture to the winter monsoon. The Pacific counterpart of the
          Atlantic’s Labrador Current, the cold Oya (Kuril) Current, flows
          southeastward from the Bering Sea along the east coast of Hokkaido and
          northeastern Honshu. Its waters meet those of the Kuroshio, causing
          dense sea fogs in summer, especially off Hokkaido.
        </p>
        <p>
          The physical feature that most affects climate is the mountainous
          backbone of the islands. The ranges interrupt the monsoonal winds and
          cause the gloomy weather and heavy snows of winter along the Sea of
          Japan coast and the bright and windy winter weather along the Pacific.
          Temperatures and annual precipitation are about the same on both
          coasts, but they drop noticeably in the mountainous interior.

        <p>
          Temperatures are generally warmer in the south than in the north, and
          the transitional seasons of spring and fall are shorter in the north.
          At Asahikawa, in central Hokkaido, the average temperature in January,
          the coldest month, is 18 °F (−8 °C), and the average temperature in
          August, the warmest month, is 70 °F (21 °C), with an annual average
          temperature of 44 °F (7 °C). At Tokyo the average temperature for
          January is 42 °F (6 °C), the average for August 81 °F (27 °C), and the
          annual average 61 °F (16 °C). Inland from Tokyo, Nagano is cooler,
          with an annual average temperature of 53 °F (12 °C), whereas an annual
          average of 57 °F (14 °C) occurs on the Sea of Japan coast at Kanazawa.
          The warmest temperatures occur on Kyushu and the southern islands; at
          Kagoshima, the mean temperature for January is 46 °F (8 °C), the mean
          for August is 82 °F (28 °C), and the average is 64 °F (18 °C).

      <h1>Precipitation</h1>
      <div class="precipitation">
        <p>
          Precipitation in the form of rain and snow is plentiful throughout the
          islands. Maximum precipitation falls in the early summer, and the
          minimum occurs in winter—except on the Sea of Japan coast, which
          receives the country’s highest snowfall. The summer rainy season
          occurs through June and July; it is known as the baiu (“plum rain”)
          because it begins when the plums ripen. Torrential rains accompany the
          typhoons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Precipitation patterns vary with topography, but most of the country
          receives more than 40 inches (1,020 mm) annually, mainly as rain
          during the summer. The smallest amount of precipitation occurs on
          eastern Hokkaido, where only 36 inches (920 mm) fall annually at
          Obihiro, whereas the mountainous interior of the Kii Peninsula of
          central Honshu receives more than 160 inches (4,060 mm) annually.
          Varying amounts of snow fall on Japan. From November to April snow
          blankets Hokkaido, northern and interior Honshu, and the northwest
          coast.

            agriculture or by the introduction of foreign species to the
            islands. Semitropical rainforest prevails in the Ryukyu and Bonin
            archipelagoes and contains various kinds of mulberries, camphor,
            oaks, and ferns (including tree ferns); madder and lianas are found
            as undergrowth. In the Amami Islands this type of plant life occurs
            only on lowlands, but it grows at higher elevations to the south.

            >The laurel forest zone of evergreen, broad-leaved trees extends
            from the southwestern islands northward to the lowlands of northern
            Honshu. Camphor, pasanias, Japanese evergreen oaks, camellias, and
            hollies are typical trees, with various kinds of ferns as
            undergrowth. In Kyushu, the evergreen zone reaches elevations above
            3,300 feet (1,000 meters), but its vertical limit decreases
            northeastward across Honshu. In general, camphor dominates in the
            littoral lowlands, pasania in sunny and well-drained sites, and
            Japanese evergreen oak in the foggy and cloudy inlands. In the
            southwestern Hondo region (western Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu) are
            ficus and fan palm. The coastal dunes are dominated by pine trees.
            Natural stands of Japanese cedars, some containing trees that are
            more than 2,000 years old, occur above 2,300 feet (700 meters) on
            Yaku Island, south of Kyushu.</label

          <h2>Flora</h2>
          <p>
            Deciduous broad-leaved forests develop in the higher and more
            northerly portions of the laurel forest zone. In Kyushu, this type
            of forest occurs above 3,300 feet, but it gradually descends
            northward to sea level in northern Honshu. Its upper limit reaches
            6,000 feet (1,800 meters) in Shikoku and 5,000 feet (1,500 meters)
            in central Honshu. Representative trees are beeches, katsura trees,
            maples, oaks, and birches, rising above an undergrowth of various
            species of bamboo. All these trees, but especially the maples, are
            admired for their beautiful fall colors. The deciduous trees have
            been occasionally replaced by larches, false cypresses, false
            arborvitaes, Japanese cedars, Japanese red pines, Japanese black
            pines, and other coniferous species. The deciduous zone extends into
            western Hokkaido, where beeches terminate at the southwestern
            peninsula and further northeastward are replaced by basswoods and
            maples. Some stands of conifers are mixed with the representative
            forests of this zone.
          </p>
          <p class="hokkaido">
            Coniferous trees are numerous in the north and eastern periphery of
            Hokkaido up to elevations of 2,300 feet. Sakhalin spruces, Sakhalin
            firs, blue firs, and Yezo spruces are mixed with such deciduous
            trees as birches, oaks, and maples and dense undergrowth of mosses
            and lichens. Coniferous trees are mixed with deciduous vegetation in
            southwestern Hokkaido and occur in the higher portion of central
            Honshu and Shikoku. High-elevation small shrubs, creeping pines, and
            alpine plants grow in the high mountain knots of central Honshu
            above 8,000 feet (2,400 meters). This zone gradually descends
            northward to the Hakkōda Mountains, in northern Honshu, at 4,600
            feet (1,400 meters) and to the Daisetsu Mountains, in central
            Hokkaido, at about 3,600 feet (1,100 meters).
